VagrantTools :: README

Vagrant Story is a PlayStation video game developed and published by
Square and released in 2000. It has an unusual RPG game
mechanic. Instead of leveling your character, you level your armor and
weapons. The game has workshops where you can disassemble your items
and combine the elements to create new items.

About the same time I started learning Scala, Sony re-released Vagrant
Story for the PlayStation 3 and I played it again. I thought it would
be an intersting exercise to write a tool that shows combination
results.

The data is parsed from a GameFAQ created by Jay Tilton. The tools and
web app are written in Scala. I created the web interface with the Lift
web framework. A MySQL database stores the data. Mapper provides data
access. I wrote the code in Emacs scala-mode and built it with Maven.
